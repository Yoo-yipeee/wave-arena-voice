/**
 * FINAL — depth of field, tone mapping, colour space and grade in ONE pass.
 *
 * This used to be four passes: bloom -> OutputPass -> DOF -> grade. Measured on
 * an Intel Iris Xe at 2880x1620 that chain cost 38ms of a 57ms frame, and the
 * three post passes alone cost 12-13ms EACH while doing almost no arithmetic.
 * The reason is bandwidth, not maths: every full-screen pass reads and writes a
 * half-float RGBA buffer, which at that resolution is ~75MB of memory traffic
 * per pass, and an integrated GPU shares that bandwidth with the CPU. The
 * number of texture taps barely matters. The number of PASSES is everything.
 *
 * So the taps here are cheap and the passes are not, and all three collapse.
 *
 * Order is deliberate: blur first, in linear HDR, then tone map, then encode,
 * then grade. Blurring before tone mapping is also the physically sensible
 * order — an out-of-focus highlight should spread its real energy and only then
 * be rolled off, which is what makes a bright crest go soft instead of grey.
