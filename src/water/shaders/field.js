/**
 * The shared wave field — an actual water surface rather than a sum of shapes.
 *
 * The previous version added gaussian bumps, lobes and rings at fixed radii
 * straight into the height. That is a terrain generator: the result reads as a
 * graph of the music, not as water, because nothing in it obeys how water
 * behaves. Real water only ever does one thing — a disturbance spreads outward,
 * loses energy, and interferes with every other disturbance.
 *
 * So the music no longer draws shapes. It places SOURCES, and the surface is
 * the superposition of the waves they radiate:
 *
 *   displacement = gerstner swell        ambient, always breathing
 *                + radiating sources     music-driven, propagating, interfering
 *                + transient impulses    strikes: kick, snare, drops
 *                + capillary detail      fine ripples riding the big ones
 *
 * Two details carry most of the realism. Gerstner waves displace HORIZONTALLY
 * as well as vertically, which is what gives water its pinched crests and broad
 * flat troughs — a pure sine surface always looks like rubber. And source
 * amplitude falls as 1/sqrt(distance), because a circular wavefront spreads its
 * energy around an ever-growing circumference.
