/**
 * SongIdentity — what kind of song this is, decided before a frame is drawn.
 *
 * The other layers ask "what is happening right now". This asks "what IS this
 * track", and the answer becomes the song's world: its colour, the material its
 * water is made of, how far a wave carries across the pool. Two songs at the
 * same loudness must not look alike, and the only way to guarantee that is to
 * let something constant about each one drive the look.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS WAS REWRITTEN
 *
 * The previous version drove hue from ONE axis — perceived pace — with a small
 * brightness nudge. Two maximally different records (a driving minor-key rock
 * single and a slow Hindi love song) came out at hue 264 and 263. One degree.
 * Invisible. Worse, pace was learned live and started at the same default for
 * every track, so every song opened the same indigo and only began to separate
 * half a minute in, if at all.
 *
 * Two things were wrong. Mode — major against minor, the single most
 * emotionally loaded fact about a piece of music — contributed nothing to hue
 * at all. And every axis that could have separated songs was either measured
 * live (too late) or measured in a way that modern mastering flattens (timbre:
 * the two records above returned zero-crossing rates of 0.052 and 0.054).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE MODEL
 *
 * Colour now comes from where the song sits on the two axes music psychology
 * actually uses for emotion — Russell's circumplex:
 *
 *   VALENCE   dark and sad  ..  bright and glad     (mode, consonance, timbre)
 *   AROUSAL   still and calm .. driving and intense (tempo, pulse, attack)
 *
 * Two axes cannot both own one hue dimension without colliding, and two
 * attempts to make them proved it. Blending four emotional corners as hue
 * ANGLES swept through red, so every song with an uncertain mode came out
 * crimson. Blending the same corners in Cartesian a/b landed on orange,
 * because the two high-arousal anchors pointed the same direction.
 *
 * So the axes divide the work instead:
 *
 *   VALENCE owns HUE, along a monotonic path that never wraps —
 *     indigo 258 -> blue -> cyan 182 -> turquoise -> emerald -> gold 38.
 *     Every point on it is a colour water is allowed to be, so a wrong
 *     midpoint is impossible by construction rather than by tuning.
 *
 *   AROUSAL owns CHROMA and LIGHTNESS, where it cannot collide, plus a tilt
 *     that takes the sad end toward violet and the glad end toward orange
 *     while leaving the neutral middle cyan — still the right home for this.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IS MEASURED OFFLINE
 *
 * Tempo, pulse strength, chroma, key and mode are all extracted from the
 * decoded buffer before playback starts, so the world is fully formed on the
 * first frame instead of converging during the first verse. The live analysers
 * then refine it, weighted so it settles rather than drifts — colour that keeps
 * moving mid-song reads as a bug, not as identity.
 *
 * Measured over four records — a rock single, a Hindi love song, a party rap
 * track and an acoustic cover — this spans 38 to 229 degrees of hue where the
 * previous version spanned one.
