/**
 * The look, as a continuous ramp rather than eight named rooms.
 *
 * This used to be a table of eight sections — silence, intro, verse, build,
 * drop, chorus, break, outro — with a state machine choosing one, minimum dwell
 * times, and hysteresis bands to stop it flapping. It flapped anyway: measured
 * over twenty seconds of one slow love song the arena passed through verse,
 * build, drop and chorus, and being labelled a "drop" is what made a tender
 * song erupt. Every crossing was a step change in twelve parameters at once,
 * and after the multiplication chain was removed from height, that stepping was
 * the largest remaining source of the randomness this whole thing was accused
 * of.
 *
 * A song does not have eight states. It has an amount of intensity that moves
 * continuously, and a sense of whether it is gathering or spending. So there
 * are two continuous coordinates now and no machine at all:
 *
 *   level  0..1  how big this moment is, against the track's own range
 *   lift   0..1  how much it is gathering toward something
 *
 * `level` comes straight from the plan's relative level, which was always a
 * continuous number — the old machine's whole job was to threshold it into
 * labels and then look those labels back up. That round trip is gone.
 *
 * These anchors are the old table's values placed at the level they described,
 * and blendLook interpolates between them. A drop is still an EVENT, because a
 * drop is a moment rather than a region.

    // can frame, and the arena becomes a wall.
    // In a lyric-driven song the singer carries the intensity, and a belt can
    // land at the same RMS as the verse that preceded it — modern masters are
    // compressed flat. Vocal effort therefore drives height alongside level,
    // and the arena eases back in the breath between phrases.
    // ---- ONE driver ------------------------------------------------------
    //
    // Height used to be the product of eight terms — section, loudness, voice,
    // build, bass, eruption, breath and arousal — then raised to a power. Every
    // one was individually defensible and the result was unpredictable, because
    // multiplication compounds: when three drifted down together the water went
    // flat, and no single term looked wrong when you inspected it. Nothing was
    // in charge, so nothing could be reasoned about.
    //
    // Now one number decides how big the water is. Loudness and vocal effort
    // are combined into it BEFORE anything else sees them — a sung line and a
    // loud band are two ways of saying the same thing, so whichever is carrying
    // the music wins — and it is smoothed on its own clock so it cannot
    // flicker. Everything else either sets its range or adds to it.
    //
    // THE VOICE DELTA. In studio the loud band and the sung line are weighted
    // as equals and whichever is carrying the music wins. Here the singer IS
    // the music: their line is worth more than the mix behind it, so a belt
    // over a thin arrangement raises the water further than a full band
    // playing at the same RMS. The band alone still moves it -- an
    // instrumental passage is not silence -- but it moves it less.
    // The singer leads by weight (1.18 against 0.80), and the top of the range
    // is compressed rather than clipped.
    //
    // clamp01 was the wrong tool here. Giving the voice a gain above 1 is what
    // makes it lead, but it also pushes the sum past the ceiling on anything
    // loud and sung hard, and a hard clip there does not just limit the peak --
    // it deletes every difference above it, so the water stops answering the
    // song exactly where the song is doing the most. A soft knee keeps the
    // ordering intact all the way up: 0.9 and 1.4 still render differently.
    //
    // Below the knee nothing is touched, because the quiet end was never the
    // problem and height goes as energy^1.35, which is least sensitive there --
    // scaling the whole driver down to make room at the top cost a ballad its
    // range (measured: tumhiho 0.21 -> 0.08) to fix a problem it did not have.
